The files in this folder were created for the course project in the Coursera course entitled **Getting and Cleaning Data** offfered by John Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The course project consists of the following steps:

1. merging the training and the test sets to create one data set,
2. extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,
3. changing the name of activities to descriptive names in the data set,
4. modifying labels of the data set with descriptive variable names,
5. creating a separate data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The folder has the following files:

* tidy_data.txt

    *the data set created in step 5*

* CodeBook.md

    *code book explaining the procedures to get the outcome*

* run_analysis.R

    *R script that produces the outcome*
